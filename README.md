The database is in the MYSql folder
The objective of the application is to analyze and visualize car sales data during the years 2022 and 2023 using the Pandas and Matplotlib (Pyplot) libraries. This application allows users to explore and understand car sales trends over these specific two years.
To achieve this goal, the application will perform the following actions:
Data loading: The application will load car sales data for the years 2022 and 2023 from a data source such as a CSV file and save them in a database.
Data processing: Using the Pandas library, the application will clean and prepare the data for analysis. This may include removing outliers, correcting format errors, and aggregating data if necessary.
Data analysis: The application will perform exploratory data analysis. This may include calculating descriptive statistics as well as visualizing the data using bar charts, line charts, histograms, etc.
Data visualization: Using the Matplotlib (Pyplot) library, the application will generate data visualizations to facilitate interpretation and decision-making.
The main features of the application are as follows:
Daily sales analysis: The application allows users to visualize car sales based on days, helping them identify daily and seasonal sales patterns.
Top 5 dealerships with the highest car sales: The application shows users the top five dealerships that have sold the most cars during the analysis period, allowing them to identify key players in the market.
Top 10 car companies by sales: The application shows users the top ten car companies that have recorded the highest sales volume during the analyzed period, allowing them to identify the leading car manufacturers.
Number of cars sold per month: The application provides users with a monthly view of the number of cars sold, allowing them to see sales trends over time and identify months with high or low sales.
Top 10 best-selling cars: The application shows users the top ten best-selling cars during the analysis period, allowing them to identify the most popular models among buyers.
Company growth and sales: The application calculates and displays the growth of sales for each car company during the analysis period, helping users understand how each manufacturer's sales have evolved over time
The application's user interface is described as follows:
Application startup: The application begins running from the main.py file. When running this file, the process of connecting to the database starts, and the login screen is displayed.
Login: On the login screen, users must provide their credentials (username and password) to access the application. If the user is valid, they are allowed to access the main menu.


Main Menu: Once the user has successfully logged in, they are presented with a main menu that displays the different available options. These options may include functions such as viewing daily sales, top-selling dealerships, top-selling car companies, etc.
 
Access to Functions: Depending on the user's role (user or administrator), they will be given access to different functions. For example, a regular user may access options for viewing charts or data in the console, while an administrator may access additional functions such as editing or deleting users.
Data Visualization: After selecting an option from the menu, the user can visualize the data either visually through charts generated by the chart library used in the application (such as Matplotlib) or in tabular form in the console. This allows for easy understanding of the data and trends. You can choose to view one item or all items.
 
Administrator Functions: Administrators have additional access to edit, delete, and view information of all users in the system. This allows them to manage user accounts and ensure the security and integrity of the application.
